# TCP-IP
Congestion Management, Header Compression, and QoS Strategies

Simulation of TCP Tahoe for a Ring Network Topolgy 

Latency and Throughput are calculated for the network and each node for comparision with other TCP Congestion Control Algorithms. For simplicity, Varying Round Trip Times (RTT) are not considered.
